The third project of The Odin Project curriculum.
This time its a fully functional calculator with styles and functionalities
Expected learning outcomes
HTML
CSS (mainly grid)
Javascript (DOM manipulation, Event Listeners etc.)
Done with the project but there is a minor bug. When a large number is evaluated.The screen stops updating. This has to do with the appendNumber function and the comparison between the userInput and the result. This occurs because for very large numbers, the userInput is a substring of the whole bit and thus the comparison fails.
